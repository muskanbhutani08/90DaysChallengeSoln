**GIT STASH--  command that allows you to temporarily save changes you have made in your working directory, without committing them
useful when you need to switch to a different branch to work on something else, but you don't want to commit the changes you've made
also use git stash drop to delete a stash and git stash clear to delete all the stashes.

**CHERRY PICK--  command that allows you to select specific commits from one branch and apply them to another
useful when you want to selectively apply changes that were made in one branch to another
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Conflicts -- can occur when you merge or rebase branches that have diverged, and you need to manually resolve the conflicts before git can proceed with the merge/rebase
git status command shows the files that have conflicts
